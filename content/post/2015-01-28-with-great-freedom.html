<p>The average psychologist’s statistical toolkit is expanding. Multilevel (mixed effects) models are now routinely used where 10 years ago repeated measures ANOVA prevailed. Bayesian statistics are coming. Isn’t this fantastic?</p>
<p>Well, yes and no. Here is a quote about the use of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X12001180">multilevel models by psycholinguists</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a recent workshop on mixed-effects models, a prominent psycholinguist memorably quipped that <strong>encouraging psycholinguists to use linear mixed-effects models was like giving shotguns to toddlers</strong>. Might the field be better off without complicated mixed-effects modeling, and the potential for misuse it brings?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is a quote about the increasing <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/badbayesmain.pdf">use of Bayesian statistics</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Brad Efron wrote in 1986, Bayesian theory requires a great deal of thought about the given situation to apply sensibly, and <strong>recommending that scientists use Bayes’ theorem is like giving the neighborhood kids the key to your F-16.</strong></p>

<p>Where are all these F-16s piloted by shotgun-wielding toddlers?</p>
