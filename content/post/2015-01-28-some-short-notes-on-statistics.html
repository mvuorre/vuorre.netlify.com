<p>“Most researchers, [a prominent textbook author] argued, are not really interested in statistical thinking, but only in how to get their papers published.”</p>

<p>The article offers an idiosyncratic, interesting and to my mind an agreeable yet discomforting view of the historical development of the NHSTP–Null Hypothesis Significance Testing Procedure–and its perils.</p>
<p>It’s full of interesting historical trivia, such as R.D. Luce’s comment on NHSTP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[The NHSTP ritual represents] mindless hypothesis testing in lieu of doing good research: measuring effects, constructing substantive theories of some depth, and developing probability models and statistical procedures suited to these theories”</p>

<h1>Progress?</h1>
<p>But that was 10 years ago. Now that research integrity is in the spotlight, things are much better. We all care about things like <a href="http://riddlet.github.io/Lab-Meeting/">uncertainty</a> and sampling variance. Scientists pursue the Truth relentlessly, ignoring trivialities like personal hygiene and careers; journalists convey accurate summaries of recent findings; and so forth.</p>
