summary: "In this blog post, I use metadata from 70k Psychology journal articles, published in 25 journals from Scopus, to visualize 'consciousness hubs', or academic institutions that publish (more than other institutions) research on consciousness."

<p>Previously, I used metadata from a selection of ~20 Psychology journals to explore citations and publication numbers and to draw co-author networks. Today, I’m interested in looking at the distribution of interest in consciousness as a research topic. I’ll first look at the time-course of this topic in the psychological literature, and then visualize “consciousness hubs”, i.e. academic institutions that publish research on consciousness.</p>
<p>You might ask: “Why”? Some decades ago, scientific research on this topic was somewhat limited, or so I am told (e.g. Gray 2004). Today there are at least two scientific conferences (which I frequent) on the topic, and it is not uncommon to find “consciousness” listed on an early career researchers webpage as a research interest. It is then natural to ask how this interest has changed over time in the literature, and if there are institutions, cities, or countries where this research interest is particularly common. I used data from the <a href="https://github.com/mvuorre/psychLit/">psychLit R data package</a> to address these questions.</p>

<h1>Interest in consciousness across time</h1>
<p>I first asked if there was, across all the 20 journals in the database, any obvious change in how often the term “consciousness” was mentioned.</p>

<p>The upward trend after 1995 or so, in Figure <a href="#fig:term-count">1</a>, seems to verify the anecdote that for many decades, this topic was off limits for mainstream psychology. Or does it? Maybe there are now more articles overall. To find out, we can compare the term to another one, such as “attention”:</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:term-count-comparison"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2: Number of articles where ‘consciousness’ was used in either the keywords or abstracts, compared to the number of articles on ‘attention’.
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:term-count-comparison">2</a> instead suggests that the term ‘consciousness’ now appears more often because there is an overall increase in the number of published articles. Perhaps counting articles is the wrong approach in the first place. It might be better to look at the proportion of articles on consciousness for each year.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:term-proportion"></span>
<img src="/post/2017-06-21-where-are-all-the-consciousness-scientists_files/figure-html/term-proportion-1.png" alt="Proportion of articles where 'consciousness' was used in either the keywords or abstracts." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3: Proportion of articles where ‘consciousness’ was used in either the keywords or abstracts.
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:term-proportion">3</a> shows that interest in consciousness peaked at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and has only declined since. Here’s an example William James quote to illustrate how the word was used a hundred years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, let’s take a look at where these articles were published. Below, I’ll show 15 institutions with the highest proportion<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of consciousness articles; these are the ‘consciousness hubs’.</p>

<p>I am surprised to see Turku in Figure <a href="#fig:term-proportion">3</a>, although I knew that there are a few active researchers on this topic at University of Turku.</p>
